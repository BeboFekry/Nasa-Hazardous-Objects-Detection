# Nasa-Hazardous-Objects-Detection

### Introduction
The mission to detect the hazardous objects in these case the Recall is so important much more than the accuracy because we can to allow with misclassification the the non hazardous objects (FP) but predicting that the hazardous objects as they aren't (FN) that may makes disasters

### Conclusion
We have a winner: by removing the outliers, missing data, correlated features in the cleaning phase, and by using the oversamplig and downsampling teqniques together with Random Forest Model it gives the best accuracy with Testing Recall 97.5%.

These model is capable of identify the hazardous objects by 97.5% wich is that main task and these means that it is doing its job perfectly
